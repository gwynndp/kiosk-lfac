Listening for a Change is built on the conviction that we are all <strong>Creating Connections--One Story at a Time</strong> and it is imperative we find meaningful ways to understand and appreciate the colorful and complex people and cultures around us.</p>\\n<p>Oral history interviewing is an effective way to teach communication skills and promote youth connectedness. Learning how to be a better listener, ask questions, and communicate with others across differences provides youth with the social emotional skills to positively engage with their family, peers, teachers, and the community-at-large as well as tools to overcome obstacles on their journey to adulthood.</p>\n<p>For the community members who come to the schools to share their stories and wisdom, they are honored by being seen, heard, understood, and respected. Through video recording, these excerpts of their stories are being shared with the larger community.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/lfac_logo_black.gif\" width=\"90%\" />"

      "content": "<img src=\"images/vom-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"164\" />\\n<p>Judge Arnold Rosenfeld formed the Valley of the Moon Foundation in 1994.  It’s mission is “in partnership with the Valley of the Moon Children’s Home and the Redwood Children’s Center to positively impact the present and future lives of the abused, abandoned, and neglected children in Sonoma County and to assure the children we serve positive opportunities to aid them to become productive, equal members of the community”.</p>\\n<p>As a private board made up solely of volunteers the Foundation took on the unique role of partnering with a public entity to help raise funds to build a new Children’s Home as their first priority. The Foundation has plans to expand its support for children through four key focus areas:<p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Continued supplemental support for the children at Valley of the Moon Children’s Home.</li>\\n<li>Support for emancipated children including education, housing and employment guidance.</li>\\n<li>Support for children in foster care and foster parents.</li>\\n<li>Community child abuse prevention.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Through tireless volunteer hours the Valley of the Moon Foundation has helped to create a safe haven for children. What they have done is not just help build a building, but raised awareness of the issues that affect abused, neglected, and abandoned children in our community so that support from individuals, businesses, and organizations is on-going. Their work is a reminder that even in wealthy communities such as Sonoma County, we must come together to meet the needs of those who can’t help themselves.</p>"
